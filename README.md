**INTRODUCTION**

My name is D Sahasra Sathvik, currently pursuing BTech in Computer Science Engineering in Amrita Viswa Vidyapeetham,Amritapuri. New to coding, have intrest in chess, anime lover.

**Why should we choose you?**  

I procrastinate less, I have the hunger to learn new things if it intrests me slightly. I can't do things without understanding working of it, I will try to learn it's working later atleast. I have fear of failure, so I will try my best to get the work done to me.

**How do you intend to contribute back to the club?**  

I will actively do tasks do which are given to me. I am mentally prepared for sparing time for my club and will actively participate in club activities.

**What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?**  

When it comes to CS Domains I am intrested in competitve programming. I think I can find very good team mates in the club. I will try to solve problems on regular basis,learn new logics,algorithms,etc. I am also intrested in app develpment I will try learn new frameworks,etc. I am beginner in this field so I hope to explore about this domain and find out my intrests further.

**What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?**  

 Honestly I felt the tasks were  bit difficult. The resources which was provided was not soo useful I feel, it had way too much information than required I had to spend so much time browsing internet and various blogs. This was my first time so it was hard for me to understand from the blogs,etc. But it was fun and challenging and I enjoyed learning many new stuff in this journey . I hope I get selected,if not atleast I wont feel disheartened but I will feel a bit sad as I might not get this kind of oppurtunity in near future.
